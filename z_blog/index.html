            <div class="block-paragraph">Welcome humans, to my blog! I will be using this blog to write down my ideas about my university course COMP301. Now I know what you're thinking... did I spend money on this website? Well, technically the domain costs approx $17/year however this was an expense I was sinking for years now so I didn't count it towards any costs. Hey Felix, there aren't any watermarks or ads on your site, did you spend money to make this website? Nope, this was made from scratch from my limited knowledge of html and css. I used a very friendly application called Visual Studio Code to code this site, then used the freemium hoster Netlify to host my website. The only thing that costed me was time. Anywho, expect to find more rambles from me in the future that pertains to COMP301. See ya!</div>
